# MetaverseFashionOpera (MVFO)
### Metaverse Fashion Opera is an innovative project to explore the border between Metaverse, fashion, and opera.

## What is MVFO?
A NEW PHASE: FASHION OPERA IN THE METAVERSE

The immersive, reality-bending imagination of China’s first metaverse platform Dragon City will combine with Fashion Opera to create a new work — and a new stage in developing this nascent genre.
A collective of artists and designers will collaborate on a piece that excavates the history of the Metaverse, telling its story from the very beginning of human experience to its realization in MVFW 23.
This is a tale of dematerialization and symbolism: from the first time someone exchanged a token for an object, or a symbol — a word — for a being in the world — all the way through gold bars and bank notes, or the virtual reality of novels and epic poetry — to bitcoin, avatars and Dragon City itself.
Featuring the designs of Chenpeng, a brand that sees no boundary between beauty and ugliness, the possible and the impossible, and the work of which has been characterized by Anders Sølvsten Thomsen (ANTIDOTE magazine) as both “anti-tradition and deviant,” as well as virtuosic dancers, performers, and sopranos.
This is the story of becoming something else — where everything is always possible.



## What is Fashoion Opera?
Fashion Opera is a discipline created by Alastair White and Gemma A. Williams under the banner of their company UU Studios. Over the past four years, five works were produced that explored synergies between fashion and music: WEAR, ROBE, WOAD, RUNE, and Hareflight. These featured contemporary dance, immersive theatre, experimental music, and a range of collections: from a specially-made capsule by London-based brand KA WA KEY to a re-presentation of archive work by Issey Miyake.
Fashion Opera has been described as “a whole exciting new genre of art” (BBC Radio 3), “a groundbreaking new genre” (Classical Music Magazine), and “a perfect combination of show and costume” (Vogue Italia). The operas have been shortlisted for a number of Scottish art awards, and recently received New Zealand’s Tait Memorial Trust prize. Three have gone on to be recorded and released as albums on the Métier label to further critical acclaim.
The methodology behind these, proposed by Alastair White in a recent PhD as well as numerous academic articles and lectures, concerns a reimagining of the relationship between garment and music. This is based on ideas drawn from contemporary mathematics and quantum mechanics: that is, the existence of multiple infinities and universes allows for the existence of an artform in which each constituent — fashion, music, drama, dance — is both central and absolute. The individual works often explore themes of groundbreaking technology and or recent cosmological discovery: including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the multiverse.
